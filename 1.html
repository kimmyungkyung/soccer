  <p>South Korean international superstar Heung-Min Son has endeared himself to the Spurs faithful with some fantastic goalscoring displays since signing from Bayer Leverkusen in August, 2015.</p><p style="margin-top:40px;">
  <img src="Heung-Min Son.jpg" width="100%">
  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">The 2018/19 campaign saw Sonny hit the 20-goal mark for the second time in three seasons, despite missing game time through two separate spells of international duty with South Korea. He really kick-started his season with a wonderful solo goal in the 3-1 home win over Chelsea in November, 2018, voted the Premier League's EA SPORTS Goal of the Month and, later, our Goal of the Season.</p>
